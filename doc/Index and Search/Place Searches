Place Searches

To find Places within a specified area, the Places library provides the search() method. This method returns an array of Places that meet the location criteria - either a LatLngBounds, or a LatLng object representing a center point, and a radius value around that point in which to search.

The information returned can include establishments — such as restaurants, stores, and offices — as well as 'geocode' results, which indicate addresses, political areas such as towns and cities, and other points of interest.

Place Search Requests

Place Searches are initiated with a call to the PlacesService's search() method.

service = new google.maps.places.PlacesService(map);
service.search(request, callback);
This method takes a request with the following fields:

Either of:
bounds, which must be a google.maps.LatLngBounds object defining the rectangle in which to search; or
a location and radius; the former takes a google.maps.LatLng object, and the radius takes a simple integer, representing the circle's radius in meters. The maximum allowed radius is 50 000 meters.
keyword (optional) — A term to be matched against all available fields, including but not limited to name, type, and address, as well as customer reviews and other third-party content.
name (optional) — A term to be matched against the names of Places. Results will be restricted to those containing the passed name value. Note that a Place may have additional names associated with it, beyond its listed name. The API will try to match the passed name value against all of these names; as a result, Places may be returned in the results whose listed names do not match the search term, but whose associated names do.
types (optional) — An array containing one or more of the supported types listed in the Google Places API: Supported Place Types list. The service will return results that match any of the specified types.
You must also pass a callback method to search(), to handle the results object and a google.maps.places.PlacesServiceStatus response.
