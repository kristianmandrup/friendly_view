Your Own Domain

You’ll likely want to use your own domain name for your app. The easiest way to set up your own domain with Heroku is to use the Zerigo DNS add-on. See Heroku’s article about setting up Zerigo DNS and Heroku’s article about custom domains for more information.

Use Zerigo’s Nameservers
Visit your domain registrar and set your domain’s nameserver records to point to Zerigo’s DNS servers:

a.ns.zerigo.net
b.ns.zerigo.net
c.ns.zerigo.net
d.ns.zerigo.net
e.ns.zerigo.net
Enable Custom Domains
Use the command line to enable Heroku to use a custom domain for your app:

$ heroku addons:add custom_domains:basic
Enable the Zerigo DNS Add-on
Use the command line to enable the Zerigo DNS add-on:

$ heroku addons:add zerigo_dns:basic
Set Your Domain Name
With the Zerigo DNS add-on enabled, domain names added via the command line will automatically be added to Zerigo’s DNS servers. Updates happen instantly and Heroku keeps the DNS records up-to-date should Heroku change the IP addresses of its servers.

This command tells Heroku that your app should respond to requests to “mydomain.com”:

$ heroku domains:add mydomain.com
As soon as DNS records propagate (usually a few minutes but sometimes longer), your app should be running at http://mydomain.com/.

Using Subdomains
You’ll need to enable “wildcard domains” if you want your application to accommodate arbitrary subdomains (for example, a different subdomain for each user account),

$ heroku addons:add wildcard_domains

$ heroku domains:add *.mydomain.com

You can check that everything has been added correctly by running:

$ heroku info --app myapp

Troubleshooting
When you get errors, troubleshoot by reviewing the log files:

$ heroku logs
